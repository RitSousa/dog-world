         <div class="intro">
                <p>In addition to meeting our donor criteria, we are looking for dogs who are confident and happy being handled. They should enjoy meeting new people and be comfortable going to the vets. Your dog needs to be willing and happy to take part in the donation process and show us this through their behaviour. We want your dog to love coming to see us, to enjoy being a donor, and be excited by the process. This is why confident dogs who like meeting new people and getting attention make excellent donors.
                 Dogs that are energetic and full of beans are very welcome. As long as they have a reasonable level of obedience and are confident, they usually go on to become great donors. Dogs like this often surprise their owners by being able to lie still for the donation.
                 If your dog is anxious or nervous, wary of new people or fearful at the vets, we would encourage you to support us in other ways. Dogs like this may find the donation process stressful. The welfare of your dog always comes first.
                 If your dog meets the above criteria, we would love to hear from you. Please complete our registration form and we will be in touch soon.

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_type_(non-human)#Canine_blood_groups">Do dogs have blood types?</a>
                Just like humans, dogs have different blood types. The two groups we test for are DEA 1 positive and DEA 1 negative.
