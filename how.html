                <p>A donation of approximately 400 ml of whole blood is sought. As a rule, <b>the blood is taken from the jugular vein</b>, in very large dogs also from the leg vein.</p>

                    To make the donation experience very positive and exciting for your dog, we give them treats throughout the appointment. Giving your dog treats allows us to build a positive bond and trusting relationship with them. It also enables us to reward your dog in a meaningful and continuous way for their engagement in the process.
                    
                    The health of your dog is always our priority. Therefore, if your dog is on a special diet or you would prefer to bring your own treats or kibble for them, please do. This means we can still reward them for their involvement in the session using treats you are happy for them to receive. Our team will always ask before giving your dog any treats.</p>
