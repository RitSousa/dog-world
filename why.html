        </div>
        <div class="reasonwhy">
            <h2>Blood donation for dogs can save a dog's life! Who ever has a dog as a loyal companion, knows of the importance of its life...</h2>
            <h3 class="reason2">Every donation your dog makes can help to save the lives of up to four other dogs. All our lifesavers help to save thousands of lives every year!</h3>

        <p class="inline">
          ‘You don’t realise how something is so important until you are faced with it yourself. Hugo became very ill very quickly, and had it not been for the fantastic dogs who give blood, he wouldn’t have made it. My husband has now even been inspired by these four legged lifesavers to join me and become a blood donor too. I cannot tell you how much this special service means to me, my husband and my baby Hugo. You all deserve medals; you are all my heroes.’ </p>
